# AutoGPTQ
An easy-to-use model quantization package with user-friendly apis, based on GPTQ algorithm.

## News or Update
- (Work in progress) - (Update) - Support evaluation and benchmark on multiple (down-stream) tasks such as: language-modeling, text-classification, text-summarization.
- 2023-04-20 - (News) - AutoGPTQ is automatically compatible with Stability-AI's newly released `gpt_neox` type model family [StableLM](https://github.com/Stability-AI/StableLM).
- 2023-04-16 - (Update) - Support quantization and inference for `bloom`, `gpt_neox`, `gptj`, `llama` and `opt`.

## Installation
### Install from source
First, install `torch` with minimum version of 1.13.0 following [pytorch installation guide](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)

Second, clone the source code:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/PanQiWei/AutoGPTQ.git && cd AutoGPTQ
```
Then, install from source:
```shell
pip instal .
```
For some people want to try LLaMa and whose `transformers` version not meet the newest one that supports it, using:
```shell
pip install .[llama]
```

## Supported Models
Currently, `auto_gptq` supports: `bloom`, `gpt_neox`, `gptj`, `llama` and `opt`; more CausalLMs will come soon!

## Usage

### Basic
Below is an example for the simplest use of auto_gptq: 
```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, TextGenerationPipeline
from auto_gptq import AutoGPTQForCausalLM, BaseQuantizeConfig


pretrained_model_dir = "facebook/opt-125m"
quantized_model_dir = "opt-125m-4bit"


tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(pretrained_model_dir, use_fast=True)
example = tokenizer(
    "auto_gptq is a useful tool that can automatically compress model into 4-bit or even higher rate by using GPTQ algorithm.",
    return_tensors="pt"
)

quantize_config = BaseQuantizeConfig(
    bits=4,  # quantize model to 4-bit
    group_size=128,  # it is recommended to set the value to 128
)

# load un-quantized model, the model will always be force loaded into cpu
model = AutoGPTQForCausalLM.from_pretrained(pretrained_model_dir, quantize_config)

# quantize model, the examples should be list of dict whose keys can only be "input_ids" and "attention_mask" 
# with value under torch.LongTensor type.
model.quantize([example])

# save quantized model
model.save_quantized(quantized_model_dir)

# save quantized model using safetensors
model.save_quantized(quantized_model_dir, use_safetensors=True)

# load quantized model, currently only support gpu
model = AutoGPTQForCausalLM.from_quantized(quantized_model_dir, device="cuda:0")

# inference with model.generate
print(tokenizer.decode(model.generate(**tokenizer("auto_gptq is", return_tensors="pt").to("cuda:0"))[0]))
```

### Customize Model
Below is an example to extend `auto_gptq` to support `OPT` model, as you will see, it's very easy:
```python
from auto_gptq.modeling import BaseGPTQForCausalLM


class OPTGPTQForCausalLM(BaseGPTQForCausalLM):
    # chained attribute name of transformer layer block
    layers_block_name = "model.decoder.layers"
    # chained attribute names of other nn modules that in the same level as the transformer layer block
    outside_layer_modules = [
        "model.decoder.embed_tokens", "model.decoder.embed_positions", "model.decoder.project_out",
        "model.decoder.project_in", "model.decoder.final_layer_norm"
    ]
    # chained attribute names of linear layers in transformer layer module
    # normally, there are four sub lists, for each one the modules in it can be seen as one operation, 
    # and the order should be the order when they are truly executed, in this case (and usually in most cases), 
    # they are: attention q_k_v projection, attention output projection, MLP project input, MLP project output
    inside_layer_modules = [
        ["self_attn.k_proj", "self_attn.v_proj", "self_attn.q_proj"],
        ["self_attn.out_proj"],
        ["fc1"],
        ["fc2"]
    ]

    @staticmethod
    # the overriding of this method may not necessary for most other models
    def _resize_attention_mask(attention_mask):
        attention_mask = [attention_mask.unsqueeze(1) for attention_mask in attention_mask]
        return attention_mask
```
After this, you can use `OPTGPTQForCausalLM.from_pretrained` and other functions

## Side Notes
### VRAM
Currently, I put everything (data, model, etc.) into CPU util one is required to be used or executed on GPU (and will back to CPU once the execution finished). Though I didn't run any benchmark to this date, but the maximum VRAM usage for GPTJ is about 6GB, which may be considered as a reference.
